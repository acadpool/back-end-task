Build REST APIs server using Node.js and Express.js on any database of your choice.

I have created two REST API's:
1. A plain REST API using expressjs and mongoose (mongodb database integration). [API - Top 10 IMDB Movie List]
2. A GraphQL API using express-graphql, mongoose and graphiql localhost server. [GraphQL - Top 10 Movies IMDB List]

Both the API's work for all the given tasks which is evident in the attachments and the code.
